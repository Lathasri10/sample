    SQL THEORY

*Basic Syntax

SQL queries are structured statements used to interact with databases. Here's a basic syntax example for selecting data from a table:


SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

*Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL statements are used to define, modify, and delete database objects. Here's an example of creating a table:


CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);

*Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML statements are used to manipulate data in the database. Here's an example of inserting data into a table:


INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

*Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL statements are used to retrieve data from the database. Here's an example of a SELECT query:


SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

*Constraints

Constraints are rules applied to columns to enforce data integrity. Here's an example of adding a primary key constraint:


ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (column1);

*Functions and Aggregates

Functions and aggregates are used for calculations and transformations on data. Here's an example of using the SUM aggregate function:


SELECT SUM(column1)
FROM table_name;

*Views

Views are virtual tables derived from SQL queries. Here's an example of creating a view:


CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

*Stored Procedures and Functions

Stored procedures and functions are reusable blocks of SQL code. Here's an example of creating a stored procedure:


CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;
*Indexes and Performance Optimization

Indexes are used to optimize query performance. Here's an example of creating an index:


CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1);

*Transactions and Concurrency Control

Transactions ensure data consistency in multi-user environments. Here's an example of starting a transaction:


BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- SQL statements
COMMIT;

*Security

SQL security mechanisms control access to database objects and data. Here's an example of granting privileges:


GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON table_name TO user_name;

*Advanced SQL Features

Advanced SQL features include subqueries, joins, and window functions for handling complex queries. Here's an example of using a subquery:


SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE column2 IN (SELECT column3 FROM table2);
